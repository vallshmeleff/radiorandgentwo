# radiorandgentwo
This application, based on the radiorandgen project, extracts a block of random numbers from the Internet radio digital stream, which are used as an encryption key for the Vernam algorithm in commercial encryption.
If you choose the length of the byte array to search so that there are 1-2 values per day, add an SMS sending block, you will get a super secure messenger.
/There is a "bug" in the application's Java code that is used when searching for a given combination of numbers in a stream. This "bug" makes the application possible./
Application under development<br>
*** A separate interesting project is the transformation of digital streams into "analogue" digital streams. When on several "sides" we are synchronous in time (but without a synchronization channel) we get identical "analogue" curves. ECC Forte??? github.com/vallshmeleff/radiorandgenthree
